# Tic-Tac-Toe
It is a Tic Tac Toe game. Here 2 players will be able to play the game (both sitting at the same computer). The display board where the play will be on would be printed out every time a player makes a move. An user will be able to accept input of the player position and then place a symbol on the board.
